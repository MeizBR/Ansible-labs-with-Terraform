# Ansible Labs with Terraform

This guide will help you set up and provision AWS resources using Terraform and Ansible. Follow the steps below to configure your environment and deploy infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

### AWS CLI Configuration
To allow Terraform to connect to your AWS account, configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter the following details when prompted:
- **Access Key ID**
- **Secret Access Key**
- **Region**
- **Output Format**

> **Note:** You do not need to hardcode your AWS credentials inside the Terraform AWS provider block.

### SSH Key Pair Setup
Ensure you have a private/public key pair generated and stored in the following locations:
- **Linux**: `~/.ssh/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{your-username}\.ssh`

The key pair consists of:
- **Private key**: `id_rsa` (the name can vary depending on the type of algorithm used to generate the keys) (used to connect to the instances)
- **Public key**: `id_rsa.pub` (the name can vary depending on the type of algorithm used to generate the keys) (uploaded to AWS)

#### Generating SSH Keys (if not available)
If you don't have an SSH key pair, generate one using the command below:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

When prompted for a passphrase, leave it empty by pressing `Enter`. This is important as a passphrase could cause authentication errors later.

### Adjusting Variables in `terraform.tfvars`
- Navigate to the `terraform.tfvars` file.
- Update the `os` variable to match your local operating system (e.g., Linux or Windows), which is required to execute Terraform.
- Update the `private_key_location` variable to match the private key name.
- Update the `region` variable to match your region.
- Update the `subnet_avail_zone` variable to match your availability zone.

### Adjusting the Public Key in `./modules/webserver/main.tf`
In the `./modules/webserver/main.tf` file, you'll need to set the correct path to your SSH public key. Update the `public_key` attribute of the `aws_key_pair` resource as follows:

```hcl
resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
  key_name   = var.key_name
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/your_public_key_name.pub") # Replace with the actual path to your public key
}

## Terraform Commands

1. **Initialize Terraform**  
   Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download the required providers:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate Configuration**  
   Check for any syntax errors in your Terraform files:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Plan Infrastructure**  
   Review the resources that will be provisioned:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply Configuration**  
   Provision the resources automatically:
   ```bash
   terraform apply --auto-approve
   ```

## Connecting to AWS EC2 Instances

Once the instances are provisioned, connect to them using SSH:
(the names of the public and private keys can vary depending on the type of algorithm used to generate the keys)

- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  ssh ec2-user@<instance-public-ip-address> -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  ssh ec2-user@<instance-public-ip-address> -i C:\Users\{your-username}\.ssh\id_rsa
  ```

---

With these steps, you should be able to deploy your infrastructure and connect to your EC2 instances securely.
```

### Key Improvements:
- Improved readability and structure with proper headings and bullet points.
- Clear explanations for each step.
- Formatted command examples for ease of understanding.
